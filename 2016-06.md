## June 2016 Updates

* @clkao setup a [hackfoldr waffle board](http://hackfoldr.org/datteam) to collect issues across repositories.  We hope to a weekly review of what's done (and archive the Done column).

* @Kriesse put together the [dat design resources](https://datproject.github.io/design/).
* [The doc site](http://docs.dat-data.com/) is being revamped and will include API references from various modules in the ecosystem.
* @juliangruber started prototyping [dat.haus](https://github.com/juliangruber/dat.haus), a http gateway to the archives on the dat network.
